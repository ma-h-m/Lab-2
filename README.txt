In order to run Networking-Only.c:

Remove all contents in lab2.c and paste in the contents from Networking_Only.c
gcc lab2.c -o lab2 -lpthread 
./lab2

In order to run Keyboard_sim.c:
Type make 
Then ./lab2


In order to run current lab2.c:
gcc lab2.c -o lab2 -lpthread -lusb-1.0
./lab2

However this may throw error as I could not test this in simulation, once we get all the necessary parts from this code we will move everything into the skeleton code
